JSON Test Data files
====================

### About

This folder contains set of JSON data files spanning a wide, heterogeneous range of information from disciplines: such as content related to social science to chemistry.
Some files were provided with the `'Dojo Framework v1.6'`

### Purpose
The files are intended to serve as a standard test-set, which can be used as input during application development of data-related applications and can be used for the conception of:

- sentiment mining
- data visualization
- data correlation
- semantic maps
- data converters
- data modeling processes
- database schemas
- metadata
- general purpose sets
- benchmarks
- etc.

Particularly, the necessity arose during the development of the JSON2SQL web-application.

Overall the content and size of the files should be typical to JSON data that is transmitted by a wide range of everyday web-applications, and some files are indeed directly captured that way - provided the content is freely licensed.

### Version

The collection is still in process. Feel free to commit your own JSON files.
